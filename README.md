# ChatTriggers
**DISCLAIMER:** ChatTriggers has never and will never modify the way that your client communicates with the server. This has always been the goal with the project. 100% client sided modifications. That was the goal even before "The Beast" (aka watchdog) was even talked about by anyone. Anyone can confirm this by looking at the public source code.
