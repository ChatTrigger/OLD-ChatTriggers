# ChatTriggers
**DISCLAIMER:** ChatTriggers has never and will never modify the way that your client communicates with the server. This has always been the goal with the project. 100% client sided modifications. That was the goal even before "The Beast" (aka watchdog) was even talked about by anyone. Anyone can confirm this by looking at the public source code.


It urks me that one person doing something fishy can get a mod on the forums to say that "it was probably chat triggers" that got them banned...

I've been using CT along with Ecolsson since day 1. Everything developed for CT has been used extensively by now because it was developed for either him or me to use. All of the trigger types, event types, string functions, array functions, everything is somewhere to be found among my triggers to test things. None of these has set off watchdog for the months that Ive been using CT.
